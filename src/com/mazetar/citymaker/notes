1. Start with a map covered in grass.
2. Draw either a horizontal or vertical street through the whole map and
line it with trees.  This is the main street.
3. In the middle of the map, build a Town Square next to this main street.
    a) At this stage my town square has a randomly shaped 3-roomed town
hall.  But I plan to add some more things, maybe a little lake like I
had in my original project.

4. Divide the unused areas around the main street and the town square
into rectangular blocks.
5. For each of these blocks do the following:
6. Like before, pick a random point and draw streets in a cross from
this point.  And do the same for each of the new rectangles created by
this  (recursively) until you've reached a minimum size (or close to it).
8. Subdivide each of these street blocks into sections for specific
houses as before.
9. Ideally all these new created subdivisions should be stored in some
list.  So now pick a random one from this list and place some
non-standard feature that you always want to be present (for example a
shop).  You can put in several of these.
10. Now put in houses into all the remaining rectangles.


1. Start with a map covered in grass.
2. Pick a random point close to the centre of the map.
3. Draw streets in a cross from this point.  One street going across the
whole map horizontally through this point, and another street going
vertically through this point.  (ie this point becomes a street
intersection)
4. Repeat steps 2 to 3 for each of the four blocks that were created by
the street subdivision.  Keep doing this recursively till a minimum (or
close to minimum) size has been reached.
5. In each of these small subdivisions, use the same algorithm, but
instead of placing streets place houses.
